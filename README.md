This is my very first readme file.

Please enjoy playing my take on the CrystalsCollector game. It is essentially the same game just I used pictures of the SMU Coding Bootcamp team. This was mostly due to the fact that I couldn't find any crystal pictures that I liked.

The game is built with JavaScript. There are a handful of variables that either are assigned a random number or hold a score (gamescore, current guess, and wins/losses).

Feel free to use the console log to cheat!
